# Webpack Learning Repo

I'm about to start using module bundlers, webpack to be exact, and this repo is for practising with the build tool. <br>
I'll say more on it as I continue learning, wish me luck.

## At the end of this course, you should be able to:
* Know what module bundlers are used for generally.
* Be able to install webpack on any local machine.
* Know the syntax of using webpack and its CLI's commands.
* Improve on your whack programming skills.

### Enough of the markdowns Ade, let's learn something wonderful. <br> Shall we?
